 * C library to write 16, 24 or 32-bit WAV files.
 *
 * The simplest usage of this API is to use the WriteWavFile function, which
 * requires the samples to be buffered at the application layer.
 *
 * The API also supports streaming.  If the length is known in advance, use the
 * following pattern:
 * FILE* f = fopen(filename, "wb");
 * WriteWavHeader(f, ...);
 * WriteWavSamples(...);
 * WriteWavSamples(...);
 * ...
 * fclose(f);
 *
 * The API also supports streaming without knowing the length in advance by
 * first writing a placeholder header, using the following pattern. The number
 * of channels must be correct in the placeholder header:
 * FILE* f = fopen(filename, "wb");
 * WriteWavHeader(f, 0, 0, nchannels);
 * WriteWavSamples(...);
 * WriteWavSamples(...);
 * ...
 * fseek(f, 0, SEEK_SET);
 * WriteWavHeader(f, ...);
 * fclose(f);
 *
